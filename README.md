### Hello! 

I'm a student programmer and game developer (well, I will be!). 
I'm using the Godot Game Engine for development, using primarily C#, 
though I also use GDScript on occasion and a bit of c++ too.

I also work on other non-programming related things. 
I'll probably show them here with time.
